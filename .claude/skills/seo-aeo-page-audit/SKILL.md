# SEO + AEO Page Audit

A generic, reusable audit for **a single web page or article**. Works on any stack (static HTML, any CMS or framework, MDX/Markdown). Run it after a page is created or edited, before publishing.

## How to run this audit

1. **Identify the target.** Determine the exact file(s) for the page/article being checked (source file and, if available, the built/rendered HTML). If unclear, ask which page/URL to audit.
2. **Inspect, don't assume.** Read the page source and, where possible, the rendered `<head>` and body. Measure real values (character counts, heading order, link targets, image alts).
3. **Score every item** in Parts A–G below as ✅ pass, ⚠️ needs work, or ❌ fail. Use the severity tags: 🔴 must-fix (blocks publish), 🟡 should-fix, 🟢 nice-to-have.
4. **Report** using the Output Format at the end: a short verdict, then issues grouped by severity with a one-line fix each. A page is "ready" only when every 🔴 passes.
5. **Apply or recommend fixes** per the user's preference. Validate any structured data you add.

Use these character targets: **title 50–60 chars**, **meta description 140–160 chars**.

## Part A — Core on-page SEO (every page)

### A1. Title & metadata (`<head>`)
- [ ] 🔴 **Title tag** present, **unique across the site**, 50–60 chars, primary keyword near the front.
- [ ] 🔴 **Meta description** present, unique, 140–160 chars, includes the keyword and a reason to click.
- [ ] 🔴 **Canonical tag** present and **self-referencing** to this page's own URL (correct protocol/host, no stray parameters).
- [ ] 🔴 **Exactly one `<h1>`**, containing the primary keyword.
- [ ] 🟡 **Open Graph**: `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url` (this page), `og:image` (~1200×630), `og:type`.
- [ ] 🟡 **Twitter Card**: `summary_large_image` with title, description, image.
- [ ] 🟡 `<html lang>` set; charset and responsive `viewport` present.

### A2. URL / slug
- [ ] 🔴 Short, lowercase, hyphenated, keyword-bearing slug; no tracking params in the canonical URL.
- [ ] 🟡 Consistent trailing-slash + host (www/non-www, http→https) — one canonical form, others redirect.

### A3. Headings & content structure
- [ ] 🔴 Logical hierarchy H1 → H2 → H3, no skipped levels, no duplicate H1.
- [ ] 🔴 **Primary keyword appears in the first 100 words.**
- [ ] 🟡 Descriptive subheadings; scannable (short paragraphs, lists, bolded key points).

### A4. Content quality & depth
- [ ] 🔴 Substantive, original, genuinely useful content matched to search intent (no placeholder/empty sections).
- [ ] 🔴 Length appropriate to intent and competitive with what currently ranks (be more complete, not just longer).
- [ ] 🟡 Demonstrates real experience/expertise (first-hand detail, specifics, data) — E-E-A-T.
- [ ] 🟡 No keyword stuffing; natural language; covers the sub-questions a reader would have.

### A5. Links
- [ ] 🔴 Internal links to relevant pages with descriptive anchor text (not "click here"); no orphan page.
- [ ] 🟡 1–3 outbound links to authoritative sources where claims are made.
- [ ] 🔴 No broken links or redirect chains (everything returns 200).

### A6. Images & media
- [ ] 🔴 Every meaningful image has descriptive **alt text** (decorative images use empty `alt=""`).
- [ ] 🟡 Compressed, modern format (WebP/AVIF), explicit `width`/`height` (prevents layout shift), lazy-load below the fold.
- [ ] 🟢 Descriptive file names.

### A7. Technical & indexability
- [ ] 🔴 Page returns **200** and renders without console/runtime errors.
- [ ] 🔴 Page is **indexable** (not blocked by robots.txt or an unintended `noindex`); included in the XML sitemap.
- [ ] 🔴 **Utility/thin pages are `noindex`** (checkout, thank-you, cart, internal search, filtered/parameter URLs). Note: a robots.txt `Disallow` does NOT remove a page from the index — use a `noindex` meta tag.
- [ ] 🟡 **Core Web Vitals** pass: LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1.
- [ ] 🟡 Mobile-friendly/responsive; HTTPS; no mixed content.

---

## Part B — AEO / GEO (answer-engine readiness)

Optimizes for AI answers and featured snippets (assistants, AI overviews, conversational search).

- [ ] 🔴 **Answer-first:** the core question is answered directly in the first 1–2 sentences (≈ first 40–60 words).
- [ ] 🔴 **Self-contained passages:** each section makes sense quoted on its own — engines cite passages, not whole pages.
- [ ] 🔴 **FAQ section** with real questions phrased the way people ask them, each with a concise 2–3 sentence answer.
- [ ] 🟡 **Entity clarity:** explicitly name the product/service, who it's for, and (if relevant) location — avoid vague "we/it".
- [ ] 🟡 **Citable facts:** statistics include a year and a linked authoritative source; no fabricated numbers.
- [ ] 🟡 **Liftable formats:** comparison tables, step lists, and definition blocks where useful.
- [ ] 🟢 Question-style subheadings that mirror conversational/voice queries.

---

## Part C — Article / long-form content (when the page is an article)

- [ ] 🔴 Compelling headline (H1) with the primary keyword; title tag optimized separately for click-through.
- [ ] 🔴 Intro states the takeaway/answer within the first 2–3 sentences.
- [ ] 🔴 **Table of contents** with jump links for long pieces.
- [ ] 🔴 **Key-takeaways / summary box** near the top.
- [ ] 🔴 **Author byline with bio/credentials**; visible **published and last-updated dates**.
- [ ] 🟡 One primary keyword + 2–4 semantic variations used naturally (URL, H1, first paragraph, ≥1 subheading).
- [ ] 🟡 3–5 internal links with varied anchors; 1–3 authoritative external links.
- [ ] 🟡 Original insight/data/examples (the "Experience" signal); not generic rephrasing of competitors.
- [ ] 🟡 Clear call-to-action linking to the relevant next step on the site.
- [ ] 🟢 Charts/tables/visuals for data; optimized images with alt text.

---

## Part D — Duplicate-content & cannibalization

- [ ] 🔴 This page targets a **distinct keyword + intent** — no other page on the site competes for the same term (cannibalization).
- [ ] 🔴 **Self-referencing canonical** (never canonical to a different domain or unrelated page).
- [ ] 🔴 **Unique title and meta description** vs every other page.
- [ ] 🟡 If the site is one of several **similar/templated sites**, the substantive copy is genuinely rewritten per site (unique examples, terminology, framing) — not the same text with a word swapped. Templated near-duplicates across domains are detectable and devalued.
- [ ] 🟡 Old/duplicate URLs are **301-redirected** to the canonical version rather than left live.
- [ ] 🟢 Spot-check originality with a duplicate-content checker before publishing.

---

## Part E — Search-engine policy compliance (avoid penalties)

Verify the page does not trip these common spam-policy issues (and broader quality systems):

- [ ] 🔴 **Not thin / low-value** — has original value beyond ads/affiliate links/boilerplate.
- [ ] 🔴 **Not scaled/auto-generated without value** — any AI-assisted content is reviewed, accurate, and genuinely helpful.
- [ ] 🔴 **Not a doorway page** — not one of many near-identical pages whose only purpose is to funnel users to one destination.
- [ ] 🔴 **No cloaking / sneaky redirects** — users and crawlers see the same content.
- [ ] 🔴 **No hidden text or keyword stuffing.**
- [ ] 🟡 **No manipulative links** (paid links without rel attributes, link exchanges, sitewide cross-link blocks at scale).
- [ ] 🟡 **Structured data matches visible content** — no fake reviews/ratings or markup for unseen content.
- [ ] 🟡 **Build for people first.** Content that genuinely helps a user satisfies both search quality systems and AI answer engines.

### E1. YMYL pages (extra scrutiny)
If the page covers **money, health, legal, safety, or major life decisions** ("Your Money or Your Life"), it's held to a higher expertise/accuracy bar:
- [ ] 🔴 Author/organization expertise and credentials are visible.
- [ ] 🔴 Claims are accurate, current, and sourced; appropriate disclaimers present (e.g., "not professional advice").
- [ ] 🟡 Conservative, verifiable statements — avoid unprovable financial/medical/legal promises.

---

## Part F — Structured data by page type (JSON-LD)

Add and validate the schema appropriate to the page (validate at a Rich Results / schema validator; zero errors; markup must match visible content):

| Page type | Recommended schema |
|---|---|
| Site-wide | `Organization` (or `LocalBusiness`), `WebSite` |
| Home | `Organization` + `WebSite` |
| Article / news / post | `Article` (or `NewsArticle`) + author `Person` + publisher `Organization` + `BreadcrumbList` (+ `FAQPage` if an FAQ exists) |
| How-to / tutorial | `HowTo` (+ `BreadcrumbList`) |
| Product | `Product` + `Offer` (+ `AggregateRating`/`Review` only if real) |
| Service / category | `Service` (+ `LocalBusiness` if local) + `BreadcrumbList` |
| FAQ block | `FAQPage` |
| Comparison / list | `Article` + `BreadcrumbList` |
| Local business / location | `LocalBusiness` with NAP, hours, geo |

---

## Part G — Site-level files (verify these exist for the site)

- [ ] 🔴 `robots.txt` — allows crawl of indexable content, disallows utility paths, lists the `Sitemap:` URL.
- [ ] 🔴 **XML sitemap** — contains only indexable canonical URLs, valid `lastmod`; submitted in Search Console.
- [ ] 🟡 Custom `404` page.
- [ ] 🟡 Default social/OG image (~1200×630).
- [ ] 🟢 `llms.txt` (plain-text site/description file for AI agents), if you want AI-engine discoverability.

---

## Quick pre-publish gate (condensed)

Tick all before publishing any page:
1. [ ] Unique title (50–60) + meta description (140–160) + self-referencing canonical
2. [ ] One H1, clean heading order, keyword in first 100 words, answer-first intro
3. [ ] Adequate, original, intent-matched content; no duplicate of another page/site
4. [ ] Internal links (descriptive anchors) + ≥1 authoritative external link; no broken links
5. [ ] All images have alt text; Core Web Vitals not regressed
6. [ ] Valid JSON-LD that matches the content; FAQ schema if an FAQ is present
7. [ ] Indexable + in sitemap; utility/thin pages set to `noindex`
8. [ ] Facts sourced (no fabrication); author + dates shown (for articles); clear CTA
9. [ ] Passes policy check (not thin/doorway/cloaked/stuffed); YMYL pages have visible expertise

## Output format (what to return after auditing)

```
SEO + AEO Audit — <page URL or path>
Verdict: READY ✅  |  NOT READY ❌  (N must-fix open)
Score: <passed>/<total> checks

🔴 Must-fix
- <Item> — <what's wrong> → <one-line fix>

🟡 Should-fix
- <Item> — <fix>

🟢 Nice-to-have
- <Item> — <fix>

What's already good: <short list>
```

Keep findings specific and evidence-based (quote the actual title length, heading order, missing alt, etc.). Recommend fixes; apply them only if the user wants you to.
